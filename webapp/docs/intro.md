## What is WatchTra?

**WatchTra** is a web application for **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)** that helps organizations enforce compliance in user attributes.  

In many organizations, user data is entered inconsistently:  
- `Switzerland` vs. `Swiss`  
- `IT` vs. `Information Technology`  
- `HR` vs. `Human Resources`  

These inconsistencies can lead to:  
- ❌ Incorrect license assignments  
- ❌ Reporting errors  
- ❌ Security gaps  
- ❌ Access management issues  

**WatchTra provides a solution:**  
It compares Entra ID user attributes against a predefined compliance dictionary and highlights entries that do not match.  
This ensures clean, consistent, and compliant data across your organization.
